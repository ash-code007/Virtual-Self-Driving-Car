# Virtual-Self-Driving-Car

B.E Capstone Project:
Autonomous driving has been a topic of discussion in companies from many years. It has always been promised that this innovation can bring life-changing safety and ease to the otherwise prosaic life of the people. Although something truly driverless is practically nowhere in sight of being available to consumers, it definitely is closer than many think. Current estimates speculate that the world in 2025 will see over a hundred thousand self-driving cars on road, and by 2035 that number would have sky-rocketed to almost 21 million.

- The objective of the project is to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn safe driving behavior and smooth steering maneuvers so as to provide a virtual and cost-efficient testing environment for implementing autonomous driving.

- The training data will be collected from 3 cameras (front-facing) and the steering commands, torque and speed will also be collected corresponding to the images.

- This data will be used to train the proposed CNN to implement Autonomous Driving.

- A complete computer vision pipeline is laid out and implemented.

- Hyperparameter tuning is done to optimize the model.

- This model will now be fed into an open source car simulator provided by Udacity.

- Python Flask is used to build an API for communication with simulator.
